# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. Performed analysis on how different plays performed based on their launch date and funding goals. Visualized the number of failed, successful and canceled plays based on the funding amount.
How I performed my analysis:
I performed my analysis by utilizing filters on the excel sheet to narrow down the specific plays that Louise wanted analyzed. I also broke down what the factors involved were when there was a successful vs. a failed kickstarter project including looking at the mean, median and range, the launch date, average donations, and outcomes based on goals. I visualized this information by using different graphs and charts to present the data for Louise. A challenge I had was choosing the correct graph that would best visualize the data for Louise and leave her with the best conclusion as possible for her kickstarter play.
Conclusions on Theater Outcomes:
Based on our findings we can conclude that the most amount of successful plays when compared to failed plays happened in the months of May, June and July. We can also conclude that this is when the most amount of failed plays happened meaning that during these months total amount of plays were the highest correlating to the high volume of successful and failed plays.

Outcomes Based on Goals Conclusion:
On this worksheet we can conclude that the smaller the funding goal is the more likely the project will be successful.

Limitations of Data Table:
The biggest limitation is that we can see the funding outcome goals and months the projects were done in but do not have a graph to display what months the most funding was given. Through this we would be able exactly pinpoint how much our fudning goal should be and when we should start the project. A graph displaying the average length a successful project took would be helpful as well so we can narrow down the timeline exactly.
